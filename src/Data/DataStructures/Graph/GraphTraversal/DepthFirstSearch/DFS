DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that is based on on backtracking concept.
The algorithm starts from the initial node and searches in depth until it finds the goal node (a node that has no child).
Backtracking allows us to move in the backward direction on the same path from which we have traversed in the forward direction.
